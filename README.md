# checksecc
Not just a c rewrite.

The checksecc is a c rewrite of checksec but has some highlights. It retains all the core functionality of checksec,you can operate on it just like the original.
## highlights
remote check:<br>
You can compile it on modern operating systems such as linux or win, and then check the remote linux host to facilitate further information gathering on a reverse shell.<br>

## todo
